#  Warehouse Search System: Furniture Warehouse


## Task Requirements
### The application developed must meet the following requirements:

- After launching, display the following:
- The application name, which should correspond to your subject area, version, and creation date
- Information about the developer (e.g., name and email address)
- A list of the available commands (menu)
- Wait for a command to be input and the additional parameters for executing it.
- After entering the command and the required parameters, perform the calculations, print the result, and wait for the next command to be entered.
- One of the commands must exit the application.
- Read the inventory data from the pre-formatted text file.
- Allow users to search for products in the inventory based on various parameters.
- When a user searches for a product, display a list of matching products with their details (e.g., ID, name, category, price, quantity, etc.).
- If no matching products exist, display a message indicating no products were found.
- Allow users to see a list of all the products in the inventory, sorted by the selected order.
- Errors should be handled gracefully, displaying the appropriate error messages to the user.

## Functionality
### The application must be able to:

- Perform the tasks specified in the project requirements
- Take input from the user and provide output as expected
- Run efficiently, with minimal resource usage and no unnecessary delays or hang-ups

##  Code Quality
- The source code should be well-organized, readable, and maintainable. 
- It should follow best practices and adhere to the principles of object-oriented programming.
- 
- Use a Git repository for the source code. 
- This will allow the mentor to review the commit history and see the progress of the project over time. 
- The mentor will consider factors such as the frequency and quality of commits.

##  Testing
- The application should be tested thoroughly to ensure that it performs as expected and that all edge cases have been accounted for.
